# WebWalls #



Network and Java languages.



## Project Summary ##

This project aims at implementing a walls service, each wall is a board

where users can freely add plain text only messages. The project is

designed for a friendly working environment without security concerns.

No user authentication or authorization is enforced, to add a message,

the only requirement is knowing the wall’s name. However, walls’ names

are not publicly available, so they can be also regarded as access keys.

Messages in a wall are publicly available and may be removed by any user,

again, as far at the wall’s name is known.

Two applications are to be developed, the main one is the server, it

manages the walls and it’s in essence an HTTP server, it provides a web

users’ frontend, REST web services and also a low level UDP messages

interface.

The second application is a simple UDP client that allows the direct

posting of messages in a wall by using the mentioned low level UDP

messages interface.

Applications may be developed either in C or Java language, regarding the

web frontend, JavaScript will also be required.
